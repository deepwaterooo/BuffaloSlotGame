\section{Updates}
\label{sec-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Major features/functionalities are all accomplished using \textbf{StrangeIoC} for main game play scene, including: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Update bet amount correctly and in time;
\item Update credit values after bet loss for each game once hit the spin button which means one more game started;
\item Calculate win score according to traditional buffalo slot game;
\item Update remaing credits with bet loss deducted, and win credits added;
\item When slots are spinning, hit the spin button again could force stop the spinning slots within fair amount of time; And since it's one game bet, no more 2nd bet loss deducted, and calculate afterwards win scores etc accordingly like normal spin.
\end{itemize}
\item TODOs: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Game run smoothly for main scene, still optimization is necessary for this game, and will do that.
\item When calculating win score, hint text on how win score is calculated could be displayed as casinoes do, as well as some animations for win items on slots/animals and/or on win score and credit score udpating is practical and possible; Audio is also possible, spinning wheels scene will also come.
\item But as I continue with the project using StrangeIoC more and more easily and smoothly, I may NOT update this project any more so that later on -- not too late I hope, in Google play store, there is some well-designed well-implemented buffalo slot mobile game using \textbf{StrangeIoC} on sale\textasciitilde{}!
\item A happily developped current game scene to share:
\end{itemize}

\item Try to figure out a way how to calculate score. So far GUI interface finished most of the design for main game interface, free game interface is still needs to work on.

\item StrangeIoC framework starting point
\item initial clone trial of casino buffalo slot game, starting point. needs more thought and redesign the project for design and implementation practice
